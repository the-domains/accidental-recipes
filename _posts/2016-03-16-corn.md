# Corned Beef and Cabbage

for St. Patrick's Day...or any day

* 3-4 lb corned beef brisket (spiced or not)
* 2-3 onions, quartered
* 6-12 carrots, cut into thirds lengthwise
* 1 Tbl coriander seeds
* 1 tsp peppercorns (I used white this year)
* 1 tsp allspice berries, whole
* 2 bay leaves
* 1 tsp mustard seeds
* 1/4 cup malt vinegar
* 1 bottle stout
* 1 large cabbage head, cut into eight wedges

If beef is packed in spices, rinse them off under running water. 

Put beef in large pot, add all onions, 6 pieces of carrots, all spices, vinegar and stout. Add water to cover beef by 2 inches.

Bring pot to a gentle boil. Check water level every 5 minutes when starting to cook. The beef may shrink in length, but bend or grow in height. Add hot water to ensure beef is covered by about 1/2 in" of water.

Simmer for 2.5 - 3 hours until beef is just tender.

Add remaining carrots and cabbage, bring back to a simmer, and cook for 20 min or until carrots and cabbage are soft.

Remove beef, carve into slices, and serve with carrots and a wedge of cabbage.
