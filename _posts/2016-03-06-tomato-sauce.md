# Tomato Sauce 

## All purpose sauce for use in a range of recipes. 

* 2-3 Tbl olive oil

* 3-4 large carrots

* diced
1-2 stalks of celery

* diced
2-3 onions

* diced
3-4 cloves garlic

* minced
1/3 cup of fresh parsley

* chopped
1 anchovy, 

* finely minced
2 Tbl concentrated tomato paste

* 1/2 cup dry white wine 

* 4 28oz cans of tomatoes (chopped, diced, whole, or a mix) 

* Thyme 

* Oregano 

* Salt 

* Pepper 

Heat olive oil in a large pan.

Add vegetables and saute until onions are translucent.

Add garlic, parsley and anchovy and stir for 30 seconds.

Add tomato paste and stir to incorporate well, continue to cook for 1 minute 

Add white wine, and stir well. Cook for 1 min.

Add tomatoes, spices and salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer, reduce heat to as low as possible while still getting the occasional bubble. Cook for 30-45 min, stirring occasionally. 

You may have to play with the heat a bit, turning it up if the sauce is not bubbling once and awhile.

If your kids don't like the "bits" of the veggies, feel free to puree to a smooth sauce. 

Done.
